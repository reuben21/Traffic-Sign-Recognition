<h1>Traffic Sign Recognition</h1>

<h3>Part of the RecogniSign Techfest Competition</h3>

<h3>Description</h3>

<ul>
    <li>We had to develop a computer vision model with the aim to analyze various possible techniques to classify traffic signs with reasonable accuracy.</li>
    <li>We also had to make our own training set comprising various signs</li>
    <li>We made use of Convolutional neural network to anaylyze the images and created a model which could recognize the Traffic Signs achieving 80% accuracy.</li>
</ul>
